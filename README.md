## Overview
An e-commercial application built as a technological demonstration. The purpose of this app is to get an experience from creatinig architecture and data model to an actual implementation.

The app won't contain transaction or delivery functionalities. These features will be dummy-implemented.

## Getting started
TODO

## Used resources
Application design was taken from [this](https://www.figma.com/file/Qo2dQqSrc788Eum0yugxrS/Ecommerce-App-UI-Kit-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1) resource but I slightly changed it in my app.
